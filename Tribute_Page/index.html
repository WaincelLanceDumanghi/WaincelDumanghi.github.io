                <p>
                    I can't seem much to remember of my grandfather's entire biography and major milestones of his life. However, I am at least
                    able to share my experience with him growing up and what he has passed down to us abling us to grow as a person.
                    My earliest memory of him began, where he was a priest in Masla, Tadian, Mountain Province preaching the word of God. My grandfather 
                    was an anglican priest and he had passion and love in doing his work, even at dark nights where there seems to be no electricity and
                    no house lit up in sight, a candle and a bible with a kopiko 3-in-1 in his side is what he only needs to get through such plights.

                <p>
                    He was loved and adored by the people around him including us his family. People gave him respect that he deserved as he has done the 
                    same. Although my grandfather had a big stomach, being around my grandfather felt peaceful and warm as if there was something that envoloped
                    you with just a lovely gentle hug. Eventually after years of service being as a priest, he retired yet that does not stop him in spreading the word of God. At times, he 
                    takes over as a celebrant on our local church at Poblacion, Tadian, Mountain Province. When he starts with his sermon, he gathers the
                    crowd almost instanlty and deliver such fruitful sermons that give people spiritual food. As a little kid at the time, I wasn't at the 
                    best of my behaviour where I just wanted to play outside when we go to church, thus, my parents suggested that I attended a Sunday school
                    which is kind of like a short learning session towards the word of God but the way of delivery was aimed at children.

                    My grandfather was very sweet and loving towards his family as well, especially with his wife where it became a habit that they would call each
                    other's name after a while and say "I love you". Hearing that as a kid made me cringe but thinking about it now, it was a very wholesome moment
                    where my grandfather showed his appreciation to my grandmother and such a simple yet sincere way of expressing one's love towards his beloved wife.
                    My grandfather was slow to anger and he would often be gentle with his voice whenever he is either talking to his sons, daughters, or grandchildren.
                    That made us calm down and de-escalate our emotions when hightened, making us collect our thougts and communicate in a way where we can all understand
                    each other. He taught us to pray and love one another and he showed us as well on how powerful they can get in giving us peace within ourselves. 
                    Additionally, he also taught us in being kind and generous towards other people even if we don't know them and to not judge them like a cover of a book.
                    Meat is his favorite food but he has to slowdown his intake due to his old age. My grandfather was very generous in feeding us especially his grandchildren
                    maybe that's why I've come to love food as well or maybe I just love them because they are vast and delicious.

                    Despite all of what I mentioned, I never seem to know what was with me until we lost him. Growing up, I didn't often much spend time with my grandfather
                    even though he was very near to me. The only times, that I see him was when we go to church, a family event or outing, I was called by them to do tasks,
                    or when I just go visit them. Days have passed to months then years, I wasn't really able to spend a quality time with my grandfather until one day 
                    where everything just went very fast. Before his passing, I have done something that was not to be done as a big brother and he went to consult me. I remember
                    that moment like it was just yesterday where he was very gentle with his voice but I could feel his anger towards me, my grandfather was scolding me gently 
                    and I was not listening as my pride got the better of me. Moments later, I could hear a slight whimper and as I look up while I was sitting on my bed he shed tears for me.
                    I haven't seen my grandfather tear up for me and in that moment my heart immediately sank faster than an anchor would've dropped the ocean floor. My pride
                    was immediately gone and I listened to him very closely as he said to me "I'm very afraid of what you will turn out in the future my grandson as if you can not 
                    treat your siblings right with the love and care they deserve, how much more would you treat other people. Especially, when I am gone from this earth who will 
                    continue to tell you gently time and time again to control your anger and not let it set loose." As I heard this with his tears still shedding I could only sit there
                     and think deeply of what he said as I shed tears afterwards then apologized for my actions.

                    Weeks later, I wake up to be notified that my grandfather was sent to the hospital because he had a heart attack early in the evening. However, that would be a story for
                    a differnt time. To conclude, I never really felt that I lost someone until I did which made me cry so much when his funeral came and what he has done to his family, 
                    community, and service, there were a lot of people who came to mourn for our loss as they were also saddened to hear the fact that my grandfather is now resting peacefully
                    and has left us.
